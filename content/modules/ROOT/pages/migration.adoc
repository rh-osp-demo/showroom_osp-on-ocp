= Vmware to RHOSO VM migration using os-migrate vmware migration kit

In this lab, you will use the following infrastructure:

* A 3 OCP controller + 3 OCP workers nodes 4.16 OCP cluster
* A bastion host to access to the OCP environment
* A RHEL 9.4 virtualised compute host
* A vcenter environment

In this lab we will first install a Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift environment.

Then we will go through a virtual machine migration from Vmware vCenter to the RHOSO environment.

Within the lab environment, you will be able to copy and paste the specified commands into the CLI.
For some steps you may also need to edit some of the commands from the  instructions.

*Be sure to review all commands carefully both for functionality and syntax!*
